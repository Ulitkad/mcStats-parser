# mcStats-parser

Python script to parse player statistics from Minecraft's `stats` folder and generate a leaderboard.

## How it works

- Reads `.json` stat files from the specified directory.
- Extracts a given statistic key (e.g., `minecraft:mined:minecraft:stone`).
- Detects the value type (time, distance, etc.) and formats it.
- Maps each player's UUID to their username using `usercache.json`.
- Sorts players by their stat values in descending order.
- Outputs two files:
  - `rating.json`: list of players with results and ranking.
  - `total.json`: total value across all players.

## Usage

Example usage:
```bash
# Path to stats dir and usercache.json through home
python main.py --stats ~/server/world/stats --usercache ~/server/usercache.json --pars stats,minecraft:broken,minecraft:shield

# Path to stats dir and usercache.json in current directory
python main.py --stats stats --usercache usercache.json --pars stats,minecraft:broken,minecraft:shield
```

Command arguments:
```bash
--stats		Path to stats/ directory
			example: ~/server/world/stats
			
--usercache Path to usercache.json
			example: ~/server/usercache.json

--pars 		Stats to collect. 
			example: stats,minecraft:broken,minecraft:shield
```

## How to determine what to use in --pars

To specify the correct statistic path for the `--pars` argument, follow these steps:

1. **Locate a player's stats file**  
   Go to the `stats/` folder inside your Minecraft world save (e.g. `world/stats/`). Open any `.json` file inside â€” these files are named by player UUID.

2. **Inspect the structure**  
   Open the JSON file and look for the `"stats"` object. Inside, statistics are grouped by categories like `"minecraft:custom"`, `"minecraft:mined"`, `"minecraft:used"`, etc.

3. **Choose a statistic path**  
   Navigate through the nested keys to find the statistic you're interested in.  
   Example:
   ```json
   {
     "stats": {
       "minecraft:custom": {
         "minecraft:jump": 523,
         "minecraft:walk_one_cm": 104293
       }
     }
   }

   If you want to track total jumps, the full path would be:
   stats,minecraft:custom,minecraft:jump

4. **Pass it to the script**
	Use that full path as the --pars value:
	```bash
	python script.py --stats path/to/stats --usercache path/to/usercache.json --pars stats,minecraft:custom,minecraft:jump
	```
